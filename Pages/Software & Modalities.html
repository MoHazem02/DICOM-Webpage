        <p>DICOM supports a wide range of medical image modalities, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ol class = "lists">
            <li > X-rays: X-ray images are among the most common types of medical images. 
                DICOM supports both 2D and 3D X-ray images, including digital radiography and 
                computed tomography (CT) scans. </li>

            <li> CT scans: CT scans use X-rays to create 3D images of the body. 
                DICOM supports CT images with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for 
                the reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images. </li>

            <li> MRIs: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves 
                to create images of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports a range of MRI image 
                modalities, including T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted imaging. </li>

            <li> Ultrasounds: Ultrasound images use high-frequency sound waves to create images 
                of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports a range of ultrasound image modalities,
                including 2D, 3D, and Doppler images. </li>
        
            <li> PET scans: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans use radioactive tracers 
                to create 3D images of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports PET images
                with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for the reconstruction of 
                high-resolution 3D images.</li>

            <li> SPECT scans: Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans use 
                radioactive tracers to create 3D images of the body's internal structures. 
                DICOM supports SPECT images with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for the 
                reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images.</li>

            <li> Mammography: Mammography is a type of X-ray used to screen for breast cancer. 
                DICOM supports mammography images with high-resolution and 
                high-contrast imaging capabilities.</li>

            <li> Endoscopy: Endoscopy involves the use of a camera to view the inside of 
                the body's organs. DICOM supports endoscopy images with various modalities, 
                including upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and cystoscopy.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In addition to the above modalities, DICOM also supports other types of medical images, 
            such as nuclear medicine images, angiography images, and ophthalmology images. 
            The broad range of modalities supported by DICOM makes it a powerful tool for the 
            communication and storage of medical images across various medical specialties.</p>
