        <li > X-rays: X-ray images are among the most common types of medical images. 
            DICOM supports both 2D and 3D X-ray images, including digital radiography and 
            computed tomography (CT) scans. </li>

        <li> CT scans: CT scans use X-rays to create 3D images of the body. 
            DICOM supports CT images with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for 
            the reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images. </li>

        <li> MRIs: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves 
            to create images of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports a range of MRI image 
            modalities, including T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted imaging. </li>

        <li> Ultrasounds: Ultrasound images use high-frequency sound waves to create images 
            of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports a range of ultrasound image modalities,
            including 2D, 3D, and Doppler images. </li>
    
        <li> PET scans: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans use radioactive tracers 
            to create 3D images of the body's internal structures. DICOM supports PET images
            with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for the reconstruction of 
            high-resolution 3D images.</li>

        <li> SPECT scans: Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans use 
            radioactive tracers to create 3D images of the body's internal structures. 
            DICOM supports SPECT images with varying slice thicknesses, allowing for the 
            reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images.</li>

        <li> Mammography: Mammography is a type of X-ray used to screen for breast cancer. 
            DICOM supports mammography images with high-resolution and 
            high-contrast imaging capabilities.</li>

        <li> Endoscopy: Endoscopy involves the use of a camera to view the inside of 
            the body's organs. DICOM supports endoscopy images with various modalities, 
            including upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and cystoscopy.</li>
