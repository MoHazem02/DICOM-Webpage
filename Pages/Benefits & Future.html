    <ol class = "Lists">
        <li>Compatibility: DICOM allows different medical imaging devices to communicate with each other seamlessly. It enables healthcare providers to share medical images and data regardless of the manufacturer, model or location of the device that generated the image</li>
        <li>Interoperability: DICOM standardizes the way medical images and data are stored, transmitted and viewed. This ensures that different software applications can work with the same image files, regardless of the platform they are running on</li>
        <li>Improved patient care: DICOM helps healthcare providers to deliver better patient care by providing access to all relevant medical information from different sources. This enables clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses, develop more effective treatment plans, and monitor patient progress more closely</li>
        <li>Reduced costs: DICOM eliminates the need for healthcare providers to purchase multiple proprietary software applications or hardware systems to view, share and manage medical images. This can lead to significant cost savings for healthcare providers</li>
        <li>Security: DICOM includes security features that help protect patient data and prevent unauthorized access to medical images and related data. This is especially important in the context of healthcare, where patient privacy and confidentiality are critical</li>

        <p>Data Privacy Benefits</p>
    </div>
 
    <ol class = "Lists">
        <li>Authentication: DICOM supports authentication mechanisms that ensure only authorized individuals can access medical images and related data. Authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive patient data</li>
        <li>Encryption: DICOM supports encryption of data in transit, ensuring that medical images and data are secure during transmission. This helps protect patient data from interception and unauthorized access</li>
        <li>Anonymization: DICOM provides features for anonymizing patient data, such as removing identifying information from medical images and associated metadata. This helps protect patient privacy by ensuring that patient information is not associated with a specific individual</li>
        <li>Access control: DICOM enables healthcare providers to control access to medical images and data based on user roles and permissions. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive patient data</li>
        <li>Audit trail: DICOM provides an audit trail feature that logs all actions related to medical images and data, such as who accessed the data and when. This helps ensure accountability and allows healthcare providers to investigate any suspicious or unauthorized activity</li>

        <p>Future</p>
    </div>

    <ol class = "Lists">
        <li>Standardization: DICOM will continue to be refined and standardized to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different medical imaging devices and software applications. This will enable healthcare providers to seamlessly share and exchange medical images and data, regardless of the manufacturer or location of the device</li>
        <li>Integration with emerging technologies: DICOM is expected to be integrated with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to improve medical image analysis and diagnosis. This integration will enable healthcare providers to leverage the power of these technologies to make more accurate and timely diagnoses</li>
        <li>Improved data privacy and security: DICOM will continue to evolve to address new and emerging data privacy and security concerns. This will include the development of new security protocols and encryption methods to ensure that patient data remains secure and confidentia</li>
        <li>Cloud-based storage and analysis: DICOM will continue to shift towards cloud-based storage and analysis, which will enable healthcare providers to store, access, and analyze medical images and data remotely. This will improve collaboration between healthcare providers and increase the accessibility of medical images and data</li>
        <li>Improved user interfaces: DICOM user interfaces are expected to become more intuitive and user-friendly, making it easier for healthcare providers to access and analyze medical images and data. This will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of medical imaging and diagnosis</li>
